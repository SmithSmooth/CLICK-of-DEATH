This is a Mini Game dveloped In Flutter. It contains circle balls which move randomly. They are two types of balls, Blue in color, and red in color. The blue balls are generally more than the red ones , but when you click on them , they give you one point.

Wgile for the red balls when you click them they , reduce your score by -10 points. You score can end up being negative, if you don't click the blue balls first.

This game has been developed by a 17 Year old , Smith, who is going to change the world and make it a better place by the technology he will potray.

Hope you enjoy the game.
